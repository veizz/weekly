**race condition**  
A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are "racing" to access/change the data.

**Futex**  
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/futex.7.html  
The Linux kernel provides futexes ("Fast user-space mutexes") as a 
building block for fast user-space locking and semaphores.  Futexes 
are very basic and lend themselves well for building higher level 
locking abstractions such as POSIX mutexes.

|rwxr-xr-T    1754 | Sticky bit, but not world executable
stick-bit 
The stick-bit on the other hand is denoted as a t, such as with the /tmp directory:
This bit should have always been called the "restricted deletion bit" given that's what it really denotes. When this mode bit is enabled, it makes a directory such that users can only delete files & directories with in it that they are the owners of.
UNIX/Linux Advanced File Permissions - SUID,SGID and Sticky Bit

Advanced Permissions
The special permissions flag can be marked with any of the following:
    _ - no special permissions
    d - directory
    l - The file or directory is a symbolic link
    s - This indicated the setuid/setgid permissions. This is not set displayed in the special permission part of the permissions display, but is represented as a s in the read portion of the owner or group permissions.
    t - This indicates the sticky bit permissions. This is not set displayed in the special permission part of the permissions display, but is represented as a t in the executable portion of the all users permissions
